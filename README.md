Title: Snake Game in C++

Overview:

The Snake Game in C++ is a console-based application that brings the classic Snake game to life. This project leverages the fundamental concepts of C++ programming, including control structures, functions, and user input handling. The game provides an engaging and interactive experience, challenging players to navigate a snake across a bounded grid, eat food to grow, and avoid collisions with the snake's own body and the walls.
